# Tien-Len
A multiplayer game of Tien Len with a Computer to replace any missing players

Run TienLen.java to run the server, with added display for game overview

Run PlayerClient.java to run a player side client. The button will connect to the server

Once all players are connected, the game will start.

A normal game has 4 players. If there is not enough players, all remaining spots will be filled by AIs that run on 3 depth minimax. I have plans to make it better soon.


The game UI is done but there is not yet menu UI. A lot of debugging output prints if you do not make TienLen.DEBUG false.
